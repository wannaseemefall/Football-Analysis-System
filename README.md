Football Analysis System

Description

        This project involves the design and implementation of a football analysis system 
        using advanced machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision techniques. 
        The system is designed to analyze player movements, track objects, and measure key performance 
        metrics such as speed and distance covered.    

Objectives

        The system aims to:

                Detect players, referees, and footballs in real-time using YOLOv8 object detection.    

                Enhance object detection through fine-tuning and training on custom datasets.    

                Assign players to teams based on t-shirt color clustering using KMeans pixel segmentation.   

                Track objects across video frames using tracking algorithms.    

                Measure camera movement using optical flow techniques.    

                Perform perspective transformation to calculate movements in meters.    

                Measure player speed and calculate distances covered.
